# Simple Pairkiller Installer

## What's Different Now
âœ… **NO CLEANUP** - The installer just installs, nothing else
âœ… **NO FILE DELETION** - Won't try to delete old versions
âœ… **NO DIRECTORY REMOVAL** - Leaves existing files alone
âœ… **SIMPLE APPROACH** - Just puts files where they belong

## What the Installer Does
1. **Installs files** to user directory (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Pairkiller\`)
2. **Creates shortcuts** in Start Menu and Desktop (if selected)
3. **Sets up auto-start** in Windows registry
4. **That's it!** No cleanup, no deletion, no "smart" behavior

## New Build: `dist\Pairkiller-Setup-4.6.0.exe`

This installer should:
- âœ… Install without errors
- âœ… Not delete the app after installation
- âœ… Work reliably every time
- âœ… Set up auto-start on boot

## To Test:
1. Run `dist\Pairkiller-Setup-4.6.0.exe`
2. Complete installation
3. Check Start Menu for "Pairkiller"
4. Run `.\check-installation.ps1` to verify

The app should stay installed and not disappear! ðŸŽ‰
